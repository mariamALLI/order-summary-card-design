### Built with

### What I learned
When and how to use display flex and grid. Also figuring out positioning layout.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {position: relative;
  position: absolute;
  top: 650px;
  left: 40px;
}


### Continued development

Will continue my development in CSS Flexbox, Grid and Postion properties for appropriate use and i think am getting better the more i practice.
